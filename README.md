# 📈 Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

## 🔍 Overview
This project focuses on predicting stock closing prices using deep learning, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. It leverages historical stock market data to train a robust model capable of forecasting future trends based on past performance.

## 🚀 Features
- LSTM Model: Employs an LSTM architecture to capture long-term dependencies in time series data.

- Data Preprocessing: Involves data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering to prepare data effectively for model training.

- Stock Price Prediction: Predicts future stock closing prices based on historical data trends.

- Model Evaluation: Uses metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to assess prediction accuracy.

- Visualization: Includes plots comparing predicted vs. actual stock prices to offer insights into model performance.
