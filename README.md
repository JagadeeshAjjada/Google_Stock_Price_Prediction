# 📈 Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

## 🔍 Overview
This project focuses on predicting stock closing prices using deep learning, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. It leverages historical stock market data to train a robust model capable of forecasting future trends based on past performance.

## 🚀 Features
- LSTM Model: Employs an LSTM architecture to capture long-term dependencies in time series data.

- Data Preprocessing: Involves data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering to prepare data effectively for model training.

- Stock Price Prediction: Predicts future stock closing prices based on historical data trends.

- Model Evaluation: Uses metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to assess prediction accuracy.

- Visualization: Includes plots comparing predicted vs. actual stock prices to offer insights into model performance.

## 📦 Installation

```commandline
git clone https://github.com/JagadeeshAjjada/Google_Stock_Price_Prediction.git
```

```commandline
cd Google_Stock_Price_Prediction
```

## 📊 Data
- Dataset Name: Google Stock Dataset

- Description:
Contains essential stock market indicators such as open, high, low, and close prices, trading volume, adjusted prices, dividend cash, and split factor. This dataset supports comprehensive stock analysis and forecasting.

## 📈 Sample Results
Graphical comparison of actual vs. predicted stock prices is included in the project to help users visually interpret model accuracy.
